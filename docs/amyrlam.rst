Things that worked well
-----------------------


* Good number of mentors
* Advertised what we were doing before, so people could prepare pre-weekend. (I had done part of official docs tutorial before and found that that helped me immensely in getting value out of the event.)


Things that I had questions about
---------------------------------


* What are the best Django/Python hack nights? Too many Meetups seem focused on talks, not hacking. 
* How to use IRC for DJango help.
